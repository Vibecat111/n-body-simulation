# n-body-simulation
### Very simple n body model made in js
It is slow because i don't know how to fucking code. But it's fine unless you have a potato device

Some parts of it are probably(Definetely) calculated wrong, but i don't know how to fix them properly.

### Any help will be greatly appreciated
## Known problems(or features, i don't know)
1. weird behaviour


## Todo
1. Movable background
2. Ui(in progress, check branches)
3. Make trails nicer
